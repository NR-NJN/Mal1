# Process injection Malware for Windows [**Halted because my undergrad university did not appprove of this and called it unethical for further project purposes**]
## A relatively simple and traceable malware written for learning purposes on Windows Systems
- Written in C/C++
- Makes use of the Win32 API
- Future updates include DLL, and System Calls injection

## How to run
- It is relatively simple to setup this malware for testing
- Load a Windows 10/11 image on a virtual machine
- Run an instance of Kali Linux on a separate virtual machine to generate the shellcode
- Remove Windows Defender protection on the folder where the code is saved<br>


**DO NOT DO THIS ON A NATIVE WINDOWS MACHINE, ALWAYS USE A VM**<br>
(Further steps will be included after completion)
