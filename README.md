# Process injection Malware for Windows [**Halted because my undergrad university did not appprove of this and called it unethical for further project purposes**]
## A relatively simple and traceable malware written for learning purposes on Windows Systems
- Written in C/C++
- Makes use of the Win32 API
- Future updates include DLL, and System Calls injection

## How to run
- It is relatively simple to setup this malware for testing
- Load a Windows 10/11 image on a virtual machine
- Run an instance of Kali Linux on a separate virtual machine to generate the shellcode
- Remove Windows Defender protection on the folder where the code is saved<br>

The [shellcode](https://github.com/NR-NJN/Mal1/blob/3c998ffaacea55bc115f268ca940788f2f431f57/MAL.cpp#L13C1-L13C59) generated by your machine will have a separate signature easily traceable by Windows Defender. Hence make sure to generate your own shellcode and not blingly copy this one (its not even real nor does it write to any legitimate portion of the computer's memory). When you run this, always remember the architecture of both your Windows machine and your Kali Linux machine, for they both have to be the same for this to work 32/64bit.

## Disclaimer
**DO NOT DO THIS ON A NATIVE WINDOWS MACHINE, ALWAYS USE A VM**<br>
